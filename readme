README
This repository contains the source code for a software application that utilizes a local MongoDB server for data storage and retrieval. Please follow the instructions below to ensure proper setup and usage of the application.

Prerequisites
Before running the software, please make sure you have the following components installed on your system:

MongoDB: Install and configure a local MongoDB server on your machine. You can download it from the official MongoDB website: https://www.mongodb.com/.

MongoDB Compass: Install MongoDB Compass, a visual tool for managing MongoDB databases. You can download it from the official MongoDB website: https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass.

Setup
Follow these steps to set up the application:

Clone the repository:
git clone <git hub url>

Open MongoDB Compass and connect to your local MongoDB server.

In the application's source code, locate the MongoDB connection settings. This might be in a configuration file or within the code itself.

Update the MongoDB connection settings to match your local MongoDB server configuration. This includes the host, port, and authentication details if applicable.

Running the Application
Once the setup is complete, you can run the application:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository's directory.

Install the necessary dependencies:

npm install
npm start

The application will now run and interact with the MongoDB server.

Additional Notes
It's important to ensure that your local MongoDB server is running before starting the application. If you encounter any connection issues, verify that your server is up and running.

If you prefer to use a different MongoDB server, update the connection settings accordingly.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it to suit your needs. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to open an issue on this repository.

Happy coding!
